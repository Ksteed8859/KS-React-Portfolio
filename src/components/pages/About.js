        Hi there! My name is Kate Steed and I'm a front end developer from Sandy, UT. I learned everything I know about web development
        from the University of Utah and am certified as a front-end web developer through their bootcamp. I've got skills in javascript, Bootstrap,
        MYSQL and NoSQL, React, and am open and able to learning much more! Take a look at my portfolio to get a better idea about my skills. If you'd like
        to get in touch, reach out using my contact form, or message me on one of my social medias below!
